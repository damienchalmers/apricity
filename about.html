     every enterprise must justify itself in pounds, shillings and pence of cash income … Why should we not add in every substantial 
     city the dignity of an ancient university or a European capital … an ample theater, a concert hall, a dance hall, a gallery, cafes, 
     and so forth. Assuredly we can afford this and so much more. Anything we can actually do, we can afford.</i> – John Maynard Keynes, in a 1942 BBC address.</p>

    <p class="padded-paragraph text-element justified-text">Providing all citizens with a basic dividend has the 
      potential to promote human dignity and reduce poverty in substantive ways. Having enough 
      money to afford basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare is fundamental to human dignity 
      and respect. However, many currently struggle to meet even their most basic needs. 
      Implementing a universal basic dividend would directly uplift those in poverty by providing 
      a baseline of dividend that covers fundamental needs. This dividend floor would free up mental 
      bandwidth otherwise occupied by scraping by, precarious subsistence, allowing people to use 
      their time in more creative and meaningful ways. 
<br>
      <br>
A basic dividend would also increase individual freedom and autonomy. The provision of minimally 
      conditional money avoids the paternalism of many government welfare programs that dictate 
      what barriers must be passed in order to participate. Citizens would have the freedom to 
      spend the money however they see fit, unconditionally, whether on necessities like rent or 
      on starting a new business. This individual empowerment aligns with core democratic principles.
      <br>
       <br>
By providing a dividend detached from labour market participation, people have the freedom to engage 
      in socially beneficial activities that the market fails to compensate fairly. The economist 
      Guy Standing has advocated for basic income as a means to promote freedom and social justice. 
      He views it as recognising the value of non-commodified work like caregiving and creative pursuits. 
      Standing sees basic dividend as enabling a pursuit of meaningful work and promoting the development of human potential. 
      His vision is deeply ethical - calling for an economic system founded on trust, sharing and mutual 
      care rather than self-interest.
<br>
       <br>
The German artist Joseph Beuys advocated for the concept of <i>social sculpture</i> arguing that society 
      and the economy should be moldable creations that bring out the artistic creativity in all 
      people. He viewed economic security as essential for enabling this creativity and 
      self-actualisation to emerge which aligns with our perspective on universal basic dividend. 
      With basic needs met, ordinary people would have the freedom to unlock their potential and 
      contribute their creative talents to shaping society itself. Beuys associated economic 
      reform with overcoming poverty, upholding human dignity, and transforming society into a 
      collective work of art. Beuys advocated for ideas like direct democracy, environmental 
      activism, and economic reforms. Some of his goals aligned with theorists Michael Hardt and 
      Antonio Negri's vision of a more equitable society built on relationships of equality and 
      freedom. Beuys staged political happenings, co-founded the Organization for Direct Democracy, 
      was involved in founding the German Green Party, and used his art and teaching to communicate 
      progressive ideas. His vision parallels key ethical arguments around shared wealth - freeing 
      human creativity, moving beyond material scarcity, and structuring the economy around 
      intrinsic human development rather than dictated labour roles. Drawing on Beuys’ metaphor of 
      sculpting society, basic dividend can be seen as providing individuals the resources and 
      security to co-shape the world around them into something more beautiful, creative, 
      collective, caring, and humane.
<br>
       <br>
It isn’t just a utopian Socialist vision either. The influential free market economist Milton 
      Friedman also proposed a form of basic dividend, namely a negative income tax, similar to 
      the income tax proposed by Thomas Paine. While driven by different philosophical assumptions 
      than Standing, Friedman still saw the negative income tax as an ethical way to provide a 
      income floor with minimal bureaucracy and government interference. Though details differ, 
      the underlying ethics of ensuring some minimal standard of living aligns between their 
      perspectives.
      <br>
       <br>
Whilst the UBD isn’t pegged to tax redistribution (as is mainly the case for UBI) it is an 
      important 
      historical marker placed on the redistributive cartography to explore the reframing of 
      territory to navigate fair compensation for your unpaid labour in the attention economy. 
      UBD reframes UBI as a minimally conditional dividend from shared resources.
<br>
       <br>
Moreover, a basic dividend funded by recognising collective ownership of natural resources 
      offers protections against an increasingly automated future where technology displaces 
      jobs. As automation trends continue, a basic dividend can provide economic stability and 
      ensure the benefits of technology are shared across society. Implementing a universal 
      basic dividend is thus an ethically prudent policy that promotes human dignity, equality, 
      and overall well-being. The idea reflects values of justice and speaks to our highest ideals.
<br>
       <br>
The vision connects to recognising that natural resources belong commonly to all citizens. 
      Citizens’ wealth funds organised locally and/or nationally could be an essential 
      ingredient in the design and delivery of a universal basic dividend system. These funds 
      could enable opportunities for citizens to meaningfully participate in overseeing investment 
      strategies and decisions related to the dividend. Starting on a local level may maximise 
      engagement with recipients. 
<br>
       <br>
Various lines of ethical reasoning lead to supporting the idea in some form. However, 
      there are risks if the funding mechanisms rely directly on continuing resource 
      exploitation. This is why we are investigating the development of a <a href="ubd.html">PV UBD CIC</a>. 
      The basic dividend from shared resources offers a bold solution commensurate to the challenges of poverty, 
      inequality, and climate change.</p>

  <div> <p class="text-element text-border justified-text">While the British climate is widely perceived as gloomy and overcast, 
    an increasingly prominent grassroots movement has been diligently endeavoring to demonstrate the feasibility of harnessing the 
    available solar energy to power a more environmentally sustainable future. Driven by the remarkable 82 percent decrease in the 
    cost of solar panel installations over the course of nine years, these community-led energy initiatives have achieved a capacity 
    sufficient to generate electricity for thousands of residential and commercial properties. The revenues accrued from these undertakings 
    are typically reinvested into localized environmental programs and initiatives aimed at alleviating the plight of those afflicted by 
    fuel poverty within their respective communities.</p>

  <div><p class="text-element text-border justified-text">Universal Basic Income (UBI), is a fixed amount of money given to all citizens, 
    regardless of their income or employment status. It's a broad, unconditional cash transfer.

    <br>
Universal Basic Dividend (UBD), is more like a share of the profits generated by common resources or collective enterprises, 
    distributed to all citizens.
<br>
    <br>
In short, UBI is a regular cash payment, while UBD is more like a share in collective wealth.</p>
